# Snapp Food main page clone
This project represents a clone of Snapp Food's 2024 version of website. It's completely responsive.
As you can see, there are two pages: d.index.html for desktop and m.index.html for mobile. In order for the foods and cities data to be organized, I have created a json file and fetched the data.
I have used OpenStreet Map for the mobile version's map. You can also re-open the map by clicking "آدرس خود را انتخاب کنید" if you closed the first-opening one. No additional library has been used for the sliders.
